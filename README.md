# 🏠 House Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project is a simple yet insightful exploration of house price prediction using **Linear Regression** models. It includes data visualization, feature analysis, and modeling using both a single feature and multiple features.

## 📊 Project Overview

- Dataset: Contains information about houses (e.g., size, number of bedrooms, location info, etc.)
- Objective: Predict the price of a house using linear regression.
- Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
